# rememberThatTime

This project aims at creating stories from raw logs of interactive system, such as social vitual agents and robots. 

Such interactions can be happening in different contexts and involve an unbounded number of types of events and actions, each with their own set of special parameters. 

In doing so, we have designed a computational architecture developed a framwork based on it to fristly convert such raw logs to an standardized notation (AIL), find interesting spans of events inside it, and convert those event sequences to stories using an NLG (Natural Language Generation) engine. 

This project contains the code for this framework in Java and should contain all the sample log files. In the main package of "rememberthattime", you will find two main Java classes of "TellTheStory" and "TellTheFunParts". The former creates full stories from the interactions and the latter generates stories based on interesting spans of the interaction.

Thanks a lot for your interest in our work!
